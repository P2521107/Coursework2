<!-- Ancient Egyption text: The text was given an ID (name attribute), to be styled in CSS (id="aet"). -->



                <p id="aet">The initial use of a form of cosmetics, dates back to the ancient Egyptians, beginning around 3100 B.C. Egyptian women were known to mix various natural elements to create colour for their lips; to use as lipstick. They would use the building material clay, mixed with water to create a light brown, orange colour to apply to their lips â€“ similarly like the popular light nude colourâ€™s women use today. Ancient Egyptian men and women were both wearers of kohl, a mixture of metal, ash, copper, lead and other harmful elements that mixed together, creates a black colour that they would apply around their eyes, in belief that â€˜the circles of kohlâ€™ would keep away evil spirits and ward off the evil eye. The queen of Egypt herself Cleopatra, began trends in make-up, her most popular being her use of carmine beetles to use as lipstick. At a closer look, the carmine beetles are a deep red colour, that would offer a red shade for the lips. The beetles were crushed and applied directly to the lips! It wouldnâ€™t cross our minds today as we apply a red lipstick, that it was first done around 5000 years ago! When you look at the existing images of cleopatra on the internet as paintings that were drawn on the walls of pyramids thousands of years ago, her deep blue eyelids stand out and is a feature of her make-up that she is recognised for today, the colour was made from ground lapis lazuli stone. In the 1963 film Cleopatra, actress Elizabeth Taylor who plays the lead as Cleopatra, can be seen wearing the legendary blue eyeshadow and thick eyeliner, alongside the beaded hair. Today, blue eyeshadow is a statement colour, but the originator of the look, will always be Cleopatra.

<!-- Button: This button was used to box out the audio on the page for the user to see audio is available. The button was given a class (class="hearbutton") in which gives the element a class name, to be styled in CSS.

<!-- It was decided that the <center> tags (which centre elements on the screen), was going to be temporary and the centering would take place with styling in CSS. It was left included to show understanding of the other options available in coding to achieve certian outcomes.

The audio was added using the <audio controls> and <source> src. The <source> src attribute specifies the URL of the media resource (audio in this case) so the media file plays. Two source files were added so if the browser cannot support one type of media file, there is another source file that should play.

The <a class = "active", attribute, gives a name for the particular number box (1) which is linked to a page using the href attribute ("page1.html"), so that when on that page, the same number in the pagination linked to the page, is boxed with a different colour, which tells the user which page they are on.

The pagination was added to the website as it provides more options for the user to move to a different page.
