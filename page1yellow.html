<!-- The yellow pages (the body) was given an ID name (body id="yellow") to be styled in CSS (background colour to yellow). This was to create the effect of changing to dark mode. A toggle was attempted to be made in which switches from light to dark mode (lab resource), however the overall product did not work and did not achieve the look following the original prototype of the dark and other page options being in the nav bar. It allows the user to change the specific styling of the page they are on. However, a toggle switch would of improved the experience for the user as it would stay the same preferred option they choose.

Yellow pages were implemented within the website as according to multiple studies, specifically from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2017/colors.pdf, this particular shade of yellow, helps people with dyslexia to read better and from the prototype, it was an aim to make sure the website is accessible.

<!-- Ancient Egyption text -->



               <p class="one" id="aeyt">The initial use of a form of cosmetics, dates back to the ancient Egyptians, beginning around 3100 B.C. Egyptian women were known to mix various natural elements to create colour for their lips; to use as lipstick. They would use the building material clay, mixed with water to create a light brown, orange colour to apply to their lips â€“ similarly like the popular light nude colourâ€™s women use today. Ancient Egyptian men and women were both wearers of kohl, a mixture of metal, ash, copper, lead and other harmful elements that mixed together, creates a black colour that they would apply around their eyes, in belief that â€˜the circles of kohlâ€™ would keep away evil spirits and ward off the evil eye. The queen of Egypt herself Cleopatra, began trends in make-up, her most popular being her use of carmine beetles to use as lipstick. At a closer look, the carmine beetles are a deep red colour, that would offer a red shade for the lips. The beetles were crushed and applied directly to the lips! It wouldnâ€™t cross our minds today as we apply a red lipstick, that it was first done around 5000 years ago! When you look at the existing images of cleopatra on the internet as paintings that were drawn on the walls of pyramids thousands of years ago, her deep blue eyelids stand out and is a feature of her make-up that she is recognised for today, the colour was made from ground lapis lazuli stone. In the 1963 film Cleopatra, actress Elizabeth Taylor who plays the lead as Cleopatra, can be seen wearing the legendary blue eyeshadow and thick eyeliner, alongside the beaded hair. Today, blue eyeshadow is a statement colour, but the originator of the look, will always be Cleopatra.


               <!-- Slider: The slider was added to the black and yellow pages, for the user to be able to enlarge the text (for people that want to enlarge the text but in dark or yellow mode.) This was not originally in the prototype but it was added for the user to have full choice in the stylings of the website, to better their experience. The slider was taken from the website https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56169179/how-to-change-text-size-with-slider.

The slider was added using the script tag and linked by the src, to a code in which provides the slider. The input tag (input type), holds values in which the user can choose from the data (how large they want the text to be on the screen.) It achieves a slider for the user to drag across to their desired font size.
